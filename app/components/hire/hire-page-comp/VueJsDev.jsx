            This framework is simple to understand and can be easily
            implemented. Vue JS does not require additional knowledge of Java,
            Angular, or libraries to begin coding, as is the situation with
            other front-end technologies.

            downloaded as a zip file. Because the library is lightweight, it is
            extremely user-friendly. It also has a good result on your UX and
            Search engine optimization.
