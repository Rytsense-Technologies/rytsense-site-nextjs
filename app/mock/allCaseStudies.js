      projectScope:
        "VIPCars had launched before Smartphones became ubiquitous, and as mobile devices grew in popularity, the company’s leadership realized it was time to make their service more accessible to mobile users. VIPCars witnessed an increasing decline in visitors, which the management team attributed to the rise in mobile device users. In an effort to retain (and ultimately expand) their market share, VIPCars decided to create a powerful, highly usable mobile app. VIPCars decided to outsource design and development. Their search led them to the team at Rytsense Tech, who impressed them with their range and depth of experience. Rytsense Tech’ designers and developers asked probing questions and took the time to fully understand the online car rental industry. Rytsense Tech produced the app on an accelerated timeline, allowing VIPCars to quickly launch on the Apple Store and start winning back market share. ",
