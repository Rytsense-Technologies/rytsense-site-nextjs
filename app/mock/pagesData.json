      "Before you set about creating any website, it is important to know what PHP code is and how a PHP developers can help you with it. PHP is known as the code you need to create a web page so that your website can be accommodated on a PHP-based web server. In formal terms, PHP is called a server-side scripting language. The commands of PHP code may be embedded within the HTML source document itself, compared to the traditional data processing system of relying on an external file. So what does the PHP code itself do? When you have the right PHP code within a file, your website will be able to show the right image or text content that you wanted to be displayed. The great thing about relying on PHP is that multiple web hosting providers provide sufficient support to web pages dependent on PHP. This simply means that your content on your website has a better chance of being accessed by your key demographic if the server and the web host both permit PHP based code. That is the biggest value when you Hire PHP Developer to make your website for you.",
      "Another advantage with the PHP language is that it is open-source so you donâ€™t have to pay royalties or licensing fees to use it. There are also many PHP developers out there (like Rytsense Technologies) that are ready to assist you with PHP website development so this part shouldnâ€™t be a problem. What will be a problem is weeding out the true experts in PHP web page development from the also-rans. One problem that may crop up as you engage a developer to make a PHP based website is that you need a developer that can work around the weaknesses of the PHP language itself. For instance, PHP is believed to have up to 30% of the vulnerabilities identified in the National Vulnerability Database. These vulnerabilities crop up because best-practice programming protocols were not followed. So you may have to search for a PHP Developer that will create PHP code that does not have such vulnerabilities. If you do decide to Hire PHP Developers to make your web pages, be sure to conduct dry runs of the web pages so that you can spot problems right away. This is very important so you get a quality website for the price you pay a PHP Developer such as Rytsense Technology."

The reason you need someone with those skills is that PHP is a very popularly used and supported website application language. Thus, you need to make sure that your WordPress site can be accessed on most servers and operating systems that accommodate PHP. The right WordPress Developer such as Rytsense Technologies can do this for you.",

WordPress version 3.6 has already experienced 6 million downloads as of September 2013 â€“ and it doesnâ€™t show any signs of stopping yet. If you yourself are new to using WordPress then the Developer you hire should give you good advice on how your WordPress site can be optimized to give you the results you want (monetary or otherwise). In addition, a good WordPress Developer like Rytsense Technologies should know how you can make your site available on multiple operating systems â€“ and this really means knowing what operating systems those are. Try asking the Developer just off the top of his head what operating systems can accept the PHP system of WordPress. This alone may give you a clear idea of his capabilities at this point in the history of WordPress."
