      In simple words, the blockchain is a unique distributed record that stores data and verifies its integrity. 
      By using a different set of cryptography-based technologies, Blockchain assures that transactions continue into the 
      blockchain database, which is stable.

  content: `
      Nowadays, Blockchain has become the most discussed topic around many businesses, especially in the IT Field. 
      This technology has made a new gateway for payments, which is extremely secure. A blockchain is an excellent 
      form of database storage system that uses records to store data or information. These records or blocks get 
      copied automatically with the mechanism of cryptography, providing a more secure data storage platform. 
      This means your data is stored securely in multiple areas, reducing the overall cost of data storage. 
      The blockchain supports cryptocurrencies and digital currencies. Businesses with a huge amount of big data can 
      hire Blockchain developers to create new and more efficient business processes.
